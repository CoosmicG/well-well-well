This video series is dedicated to Chris. I miss you buddy.

[[Old Minecraft World Showcase Part 2]]

leichtes perma hintertergrund brummen 
1:16 komischer cut gefolgt von lauterer music -> attempt at topic change
	Mention of chris and little progress -> hurtfull memory?

1:24 wowowowowowow andrew in the headless horsemen spot?!?!
	sounds tarded
		but why he here though?
		a cut exactly before this
		this does not seem like a very intuitive path to take.  
			readin alot into this one
	also got alitte paranoid bout that potato but yeah it drops, were all good on that one

2:00 
	equiped zombies? prob irrelevant
	music does get a little loud
	
2:30 abrupt feeling change (music)
	looks around in f5
	maybe a teaser for thing to look out in future

3:34
	headless horsemen in the trees?
		HEADLESS?!?!?
	seemingly moves away
		on closer inspection this might be nothing at all
			#youtube compression?
			alternatively it also might mean theres more than one
			alot of full black spots. not sure if this is how yt compression works, gotta keep an eye here during other nights. 
				sure as shit looks precisely like a char for bout one frame
			all super weird cause low resulotion
		prob irrelevant but it seems like theres a pig and shortly after two zzzs
	background huming intensivies ALOT here

3:48 
	headfull black guy, like full on black. whew hes black
	stays and stares
		might be da chris?
		could be that headless horsemen and chriss are under cahoots

4:26
	Whit thingy behind try turns away in suspicious way. Sheep would have walked and looked different
		would be a litte bad cause this implies headfull black guy to be smiley
			would make sense from arg perspective
			but would mean that smile found andrew, since headless horsemens just a pawn
		might ask andrew bout this one
