The echo of my voice ricochets off of the brick lining of my watery tomb. Forever I rest, in this damp dark room.

[[IÂ´m still here]]


another two week gap

been playing off cam

Okay with this description i kinda get this whole drowning in a well thing
But then again i could also be a bit more abstract
	in the sense of "needing to get into the wells to feel calm" %%addiction?%%

this is the last time he be in this world for a while right?
	 if so we better screen some chest content


Red Herring is actually triggering me. like WHERE DO YOU EVEN FISH AROUND HERE??

also saturation is back to normal. ingames sounds still weird

4:05 nothing weird happened recently
	almost as if things back off once the idea of going into the wells is on the table
	as if they want him to
	as if that was the plan 
		create fear, mystery, and confusion. But dont hold back when hes at crossroads
		weak idea. things go wrong after he does something. typicly
		

5:25 forgor the neverwart 
	highly relatable

8:00 ish mentally prepped 

11:26 first well travel

oh boyo brick and stone bRick buildings
	a tiny bit of xp

bone
