1:16 gooooooood ol Chris bones
1:55 good ol its a game copeium. actually well done though



%%That’s an interesting theory. At this point, if I want to make any progress, I might as well do something to one of the wells. Im pretty sure that there are more wells than bones right now though, so maybe im missing some? Or one at least? Chris had a lot of quirks. He played games very specifically, but that’s why I enjoyed playing with him. I can’t think of any specifics but he typically was very unorthodox to say the least.%%
