Popular opinion has you wanting to believe this talking about drowning in a well
But i think this is more implying at what happened to chris, and is prolly more talking about the ingame wells, than anything else.
	Cause you know, the whole chris build all these wells, and they played there for more than a year.... omfg. They had the wells there ALL THE TIME. NOTHING IS INSIDE THE WORLD. PLAYED EVERY WEEK AND ONLY EVER BUILD ONE HOUSE?!?!?!?!??!
		HOLY MOLY. andrew isnt simply being chased by these creatures. He probably the one who made em in the first place. Lethe fucking Protocoll
		Wholy Mholy
	Maybe chris tryina protect andrew from returning to the others
	There alot of assumptionininig in here
	but yeah almost be taking it as fact, that they been off exploring through the wells

%%maybe chris had some command block stuff set up, the door appears and disappears on a timer i absolutely would set something up like that to surprise a friend
I would agree with you but cheats arenâ€™t enabled on the world. He totally would have done something like that though. Or at least had that ability to do so. - andrewgaming677%%
	677?!?!?!??!?!??
