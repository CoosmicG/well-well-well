	%%Comment under vid: Honestly nothing was really off about anything. Since we only knew each other online, I couldn’t see his face. We just played a game, I can’t remember what, and got off when we usually would. Then, sometime in the following days, he just went offline and that leads us to today. - Andrew%%
