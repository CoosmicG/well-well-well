1:36 Chris big fan of mossycobble

glitched out items?
	ohhhh, either gonna pick up later or implies chris leaving in the game

A bone somewhere in here

4:16 another gold armour zombie
	seems unlikely but dont goes anywhere

6:34 well well well
	chris musta been building em for over a year to "contextualise the world"
	considering they actively played for a year, and theres very little to show, it musta been alot of wells

9:08 black man in the back
	first time musik starts playing all vid
	seems oddly high but definitely there
		standing oddly at the border of render distance
		18 sec later gone
			Musik actually sets in audibly at this point
			its a strong story telling device
		#Crossreverence showed Screw you andrews render distance, your on console it shouldnt be that low
		and of course it isnt in the first vid
		crossreference with prev vid shows theres tree large enough

10:55 wtf is that
	enchanted?

Comment section

Also in the very last second of this episode when you look thorough the window from your house there are some black figure legs
	Andrew: I’ve just now had a look, and I think I see what it is you’re referring to. That’s really weird. I’ll contact one of my tech savvy friends about this one.
